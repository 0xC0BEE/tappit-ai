// FIX: This file was empty and not treated as a module. An empty file that is
// part of the TypeScript compilation can pollute the global scope and conflict
// with type definitions, such as the global JSX namespace. Adding an empty export
// ensures this file is correctly treated as a module, resolving project-wide JSX typing errors.
export {};
