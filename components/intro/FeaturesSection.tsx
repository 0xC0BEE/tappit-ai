// FIX: This file was empty and not treated as a module. An empty .tsx file is
// particularly problematic as it can corrupt the global JSX namespace when it's
// not treated as a module. Adding an empty export ensures this file is correctly
// processed, resolving project-wide JSX typing errors.
export {};
