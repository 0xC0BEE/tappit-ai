# Tappit AI: Future Roadmap & Development Plan

This document outlines the strategic vision and actionable development plan to evolve Tappit AI from a best-in-class digital business card into a 10x better, AI-powered intelligent relationship engine.

**Core Insight:** Our competitors have built digital Rolodexes; we will build an intelligent relationship engine. Their products are passive databases. Ours will be an active assistant that helps users build and maintain valuable connections.

## Strategic Epics

### Epic 1: The Intelligent Relationship Engine (Completed)
*Goal: Transform the app from a contact storage utility into an active assistant for managing and nurturing professional relationships.*

- **✅ [FR-01] "Meeting Prep" Advanced AI Gem:** Generate pre-meeting briefings with summaries, key details, and talking points.
- **✅ [FR-02] AI-Powered "Memory Lane 2.0":** Provide an AI-generated summary of the entire history with any contact.
- **✅ [FR-03] Automated Follow-Up Workflows:** Connect the Follow-up Gem to simulated actions like creating Gmail drafts and calendar reminders.
- **✅ [FR-04] Natural Language Interaction Logging:** Use AI to parse natural language sentences into structured interaction logs.

### Epic 2: Prescriptive Analytics & AI Coaching (In Progress)
*Goal: Move beyond descriptive analytics ("what happened") to prescriptive analytics ("what you should do next").*

- **✅ [FR-05] Relationship Health Scores:** Proactively alert users to relationships that need nurturing with a visual health score.
- **✅ [FR-06] "Weekly Insights" AI Report:** Deliver a personalized weekly report with performance summaries and AI-driven coaching.
- **[FR-07] AI-Powered Goal Setting & Tracking:** Allow users to set networking goals and use AI to track progress and provide encouragement.

### Epic 3: The Dynamic Physical Card
*Goal: Make the physical NFC card a truly smart, context-aware piece of hardware.*

- **[FR-08] Context-Aware Taps:** Allow users to pre-set different actions for their physical card based on time, location, or a "mode" (e.g., "Work Mode" shares company details, "Social Mode" shares personal links).
- **[FR-09] Live Card Updates:** Enable users to push updates to their physical card's embedded link in real-time from the app.
